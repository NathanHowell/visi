# Hello World

This is a "Hello World" sample model.  It defines a `Sink` (a place
to send the results of a computation) called `Greeting` and 
sets the Sink to the constant String "Hello, World!"

```
"Greeting" = "Hello, World!"

```

Note that this file is the model.  It is also a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
document.  This encourages the modeler to tell a story around the business logic.
