# Different Types

This model demonstrates how Visi's type inference
determines the type of the different Sources and
presents the correct controls based on the types.

The model also demonstrates how you can build a model
where multiples Sinks depend on a single Source.

```
?string
?number
?which_to_use

"Times 2" = number * 2
"Str Len" = len string

"Choice" = "You chose the " & (if which_to_use then "String: " & string else "Number: " & (show number))
```
